            The hills consist of 14 hamlets spread across an area of 72 km2 (28 sq mi).
             As per folklore, when Hindu god Vishnu visited the earth, he planted his feet on the hills.
             As the people could not stand his weight, they yelled ‘yelo’ in fear (‘kili’ in Tamil),
             which later became Yelagiri.[1][2] As per Hindu beliefs, Vishnu came to the hills later to marry goddess Lakshmi,
             who is known by the name "Yelagiri Thayar" and the region came to be known as Yeloshwaram.[3]
             In the 19th century, Malai Vellalar (Malayali) hill tribes, populated the region.[11] Later, 
             the British Empire took control of the region from the British East India Company in 1857.
