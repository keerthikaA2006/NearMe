            A Hindu temple in Tirupattur, near Trichy, that some believe can change a person's fate. 
            Legend says that the temple was built by King Valvil Ori, a devotee of Lord Shiva. 
            Devotees place their horoscopes at the feet of the lord to seek his blessings.Being moved by Brahma's prayers, Shiva, on Devi Parvathiâ€™s appeal,
            gave him Darshan under the Magizha tree and liberated him from his curse. 
            Shiva also restored the power and responsibility of creation to Brahma.Shiva also blessed Brahma that he would have a separate shrine at this temple. 
            He also advised Brahma that since Brahma himself had his destiny rewritten here; he should rewrite the destiny of his devotees visiting this temple.
            Since the fate of Brahma, the Creator, himself was changed by Shiva at Tirupattur, one can expect a turning point in life by praying at this temple.
